# git-release-report
This project is intended to help you manage your JIRAs.

#The problem:

As I have been managing projects using JIRA, I was constantly have a few issues. For that reason I created an initial version of a report tool.

Following here, you will have a list of issues I addressed on my project life cycle:

1. What tests were created as part of my release?
2. What amount of code was written for a particular commit?
3. What JIRAs are part of my release?
4. When dealing with downstream projects and forks, my JIRAs usually are referencing upstream JIRAs. How to find which JIRA belong to my downstream JIRA?
5. What commits are part of my release?


So, I created this project, which is in its initial dev phase, generating a simple HTML report:
